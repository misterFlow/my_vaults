The `?` marks the check for the condition, as if asking it as a question. If `a` is the smaller number, the condition passes with true, which executes the left-hand side of the `:` and stores `a` into `min`. If the condition was false, then the right-hand side of the `:` executes, which stores `b` into `min` instead.
