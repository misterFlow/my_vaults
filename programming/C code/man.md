Sections
Man pages are grouped into sections. To see the full list of Linux man pages for a section, pick one of:

Section 1
    
    user commands (introduction)

    Section 1 of the manual describes user commands and tools, for example, file manipulation tools, shells, compilers, web browsers, file and image viewers and editors, and so on.

Section 2

    system calls (introduction)

    Section 2 of the manual describes the Linux system calls. A system call is an entry point into the Linux kernel. Usually, system calls are not invoked directly: instead, most system calls have corresponding C library wrapper functions which perform the steps required (e.g., trapping to kernel mode) in order to invoke the system call. Thus, making a system call looks the same as invoking a normal library function.

Section 3

    library functions (introduction)

    Section 3 of the manual describes all library functions excluding the library functions (system call wrappers) described in section 2, which implement system calls.
