int is a datatype for a variable storing integer values. static int is a variable storing integer values which is declared static.

If we declare a variable as static, it exists till the end of the program once initialized. For example, if we declare an int variable in a function, then that variable is a local variable for that function which gets destroyed as the function ends. But if we declare an int variable in a function also as static, then that variable will not get destroyed as the function ends and will not get destroyed until the program ends.

Letâ€™s see two examples to understand it clearly;
```js
#include <stdio.h>
 
 void func(){
 	int i = 0;
 	i++;
 	printf("i = %d\n",i);
 }
int main(){
	func();	
	func();
	func();
	func();
	return 0;
}
```
Here, the int variable i is declared inside the function func() and thus is a local variable for that function. Every time the function gets called, i gets initialized, its value gets incremented to 1 and gets destroyed when the function ends.

Now lets see the same example with static int;
```js
#include <stdio.h>
 
 void func(){
 	static int i = 0;
 	i++;
 	printf("i = %d\n",i);
 }
int main(){
	func();	
	func();
	func();
	func();
	return 0;
}
```

On declaring the int variable as static, the variable did not get destroyed when the function ended. When the function was called the first time, the value of i became 1, second time it got incremented to 2 and so on.
